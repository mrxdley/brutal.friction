# Brutal Friction

> The screen time blocker that actually creates friction.

Most blockers are easy to bypass. Two clicks and you're back on Instagram.

Brutal Friction is different. It makes continuing genuinely annoying.

- **Deletes Temptation**: Feel the inclincation to delete the extension and carry on scrolling? ->
- **Social Consequence**: An unflattering report of your lack of self control is sent to your accountability partner
